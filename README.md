# go
a super fast url shortener with html

## current operation
-intput statements which are function calls

- planning on changing it to csv-based sourcing (should work in js)
  - not super easy (like p5js)
  - plain js is used 
  - maybe i could add some graphics
  - possibly some gifs of my p5js loading animations
  - sort of pointless though because html is so fast and the graphci will be displayed for a very short time and probably wont be seen]

## maybe use json
