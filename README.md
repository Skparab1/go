# go
a super fast url shortener in HTML and Js. Basically a sclaed down verion of [my old one](github.com/skparab1/js-url-shortener)

## current operation
- input statements which are function calls
- tries to mimic how you would enter data into a csv
- might make the input file seperate
- might change it to csv or json but unlikely
