# go
a super fast url shortener in HTML and Js. Basically a scaled down version of [my old one](github.com/skparab1/js-url-shortener)

## Much faster than old p5js one

## Comparison to [my old one](github.com/skparab1/js-url-shortener)
- Pros
  - Much faster because doesnt have to load p5js
- Cons
  - Doesn't have any graphics/animations
  - Doesn't source redirects from csv or json table file (its harder to put redirects in)
  - No password redirect protection

## why its called "go"
- because go is a short subpage name (https://skparab1.github.io/go/test)
- go sounds cool and if you go to the webpage you will "go" somewhere
