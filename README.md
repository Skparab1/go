# go
a super fast url shortener with html
- currently runs on if then statements (with the keywords and urls)
- planning on changeing it to csv-based sourcing ( should work in js)
  - not super easy (like p5js)
  - plain js is used 
  - maybe i could add some graphics
  - possibly some gifs of my p5js loading animations
  - gifs could take time to load idk
  - i will test it out and see
  - it should
  - sort of pointless though because html is so fast and the graphci will be displayed for a very short time and probably wont be seen
